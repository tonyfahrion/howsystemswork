# How systems works

> At least for me

This is my view of how my Systems world works. It is not an intend to produce the most profound Systems documentation out there. It does not aim for full coverage!

It just helps me to keep an overview about topics from my daily systems tasks. How stuf is related to each other and what are the different building blocks.



## Topics to cover

### systemd

* what it does
* how does it replace previous solutions
* good use cases
* how does journald fit in relation with graylog / logstash

### logging while it's cloudy

* where is graylog positioned
* how does it differ from logstash

### modern metric gathering

*
