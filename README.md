# How systems works

> At least for me

This is my view of how my Systems world works. It is not an intend to produce the most profound Systems documentation out there. It does not aim for full coverage!

It just helps me to keep an overview about topics from my daily systems tasks. How stuf is related to each other and what are the different building blocks.

## Topics to cover

### systemd

* what it does
* how does it replace previous solutions
* good use cases
* how does journald fit in relation with graylog / logstash

### logging while it's cloudy

* where is graylog positioned
* how does it differ from logstash

### modern metric gathering

* what role does prometheus play?

* how is this related to influxdb?

* why might monitoring just be analysing datapoints?


### Containers and the role of the ecosystem

* which roles plays CoreOS?
* why is CoreOS tectonic good / bad?
* how does tectonic differ from kubernetes + dashboard?
* is there a relation between modern Smartphones and CoreOS, focusing Android 7 with auto-update?

Systems automation
* why should I use ansible
  * in a traditional szenario \(VMs/bare metal\) it's more or less clear
  * but which role does it have in a kubernetes, autoscaling container world?
  * how might it help with CI/CD, or not help?

* gitlab CI
  * how does it work
  * and why is it powerful or not powerful?
  * how is it related to ansible? \(CD\)
