How systems work, at least for me



This is my view of how my Systems world works. It is not an intend to produce the most profound Systems documentation out there. It does not aim for full coverage!

It just helps me to keep an overview about topics from my daily systems tasks. How stuf is related to each other and what are the different building blocks.
